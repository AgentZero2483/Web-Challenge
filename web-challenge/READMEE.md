#WebDesign-Challenge
In this project we were challenged to design a responsive website with 7 respective landing webpages. Each of these webpages needed to display weather analysis and visuals. 

Data Source: 
    The data in this project comes from a previous weather analysis project, where I randomly selected 500 citites and pulled data from The OpenWeather API. For this project I Pulled four different components: 1).Temperature, 2).Humidity, 3).Cloudiness, 4).Wind Speed. The four elements were then plotted on a graph uisng latitude to find correlations.
